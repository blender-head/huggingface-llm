    "The Transformer architecture was introduced in June 2017. The focus of the original research was on translation tasks. This was followed by the introduction of several influential models, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "- June 2018: GPT, the first pretrained Transformer model, used for fine-tuning on various NLP tasks and obtained state-of-the-art results\n",
    "- October 2018: BERT, another large pretrained model, this one designed to produce better summaries of sentences (more on this in the next chapter!)\n",
    "- February 2019: GPT-2, an improved (and bigger) version of GPT that was not immediately publicly released due to ethical concerns\n",
    "- October 2019: T5, A multi-task focused implementation of the sequence-to-sequence Transformer architecture.\n",
    "- May 2020, GPT-3, an even bigger version of GPT-2 that is able to perform well on a variety of tasks without the need for fine-tuning (called zero-shot learning)\n",
    "- January 2022: InstructGPT, a version of GPT-3 that was trained to follow instructions better This list is far from comprehensive, and is just meant to highlight a few of the different kinds of Transformer models. Broadly, they can be grouped into three categories:\n",
    "- January 2023: Llama, a large language model that is able to generate text in a variety of languages.\n",
    "- March 2023: Mistral, a 7-billion-parameter language model that outperforms Llama 2 13B across all evaluated benchmarks, leveraging grouped-query attention for faster inference and sliding window attention to handle sequences of arbitrary length.\n",
    "- May 2024: Gemma 2, a family of lightweight, state-of-the-art open models ranging from 2B to 27B parameters that incorporate interleaved local-global attentions and group-query attention, with smaller models trained using knowledge distillation to deliver performance competitive with models 2-3 times larger.\n",
    "- November 2024: SmolLM2, a state-of-the-art small language model (135 million to 1.7 billion parameters) that achieves impressive performance despite its compact size, and unlocking new possibilities for mobile and edge devices.\n",

In fact, the title of the paper introducing the Transformer architecture was [Attention Is All You Need!](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762) We will explore the details of attention layers later in the course; for now, all you need to know is that this layer will tell the model to pay specific attention to certain words in the sentence you passed it (and more or less ignore the others) when dealing with the representation of each word.\n",
    "\n",
    "To put this into context, consider the task of translating text from English to French. Given the input ‚ÄúYou like this course‚Äù, a translation model will need to also attend to the adjacent word ‚ÄúYou‚Äù to get the proper translation for the word ‚Äúlike‚Äù, because in French the verb ‚Äúlike‚Äù is conjugated differently depending on the subject. The rest of the sentence, however, is not useful for the translation of that word. In the same vein, when translating ‚Äúthis‚Äù the model will also need to pay attention to the word ‚Äúcourse‚Äù, because ‚Äúthis‚Äù translates differently depending on whether the associated noun is masculine or feminine. Again, the other words in the sentence will not matter for the translation of ‚Äúcourse‚Äù. With more complex sentences (and more complex grammar rules), the model would need to pay special attention to words that might appear farther away in the sentence to properly translate each word.\n",

    "The Transformer architecture was originally designed for translation. During training, the encoder receives inputs (sentences) in a certain language, while the decoder receives the same sentences in the desired target language. In the encoder, the attention layers can use all the words in a sentence (since, as we just saw, the translation of a given word can be dependent on what is after as well as before it in the sentence). The decoder, however, works sequentially and can only pay attention to the words in the sentence that it has already translated (so, only the words before the word currently being generated). For example, when we have predicted the first three words of the translated target, we give them to the decoder which then uses all the inputs of the encoder to try to predict the fourth word.\n",

For instance, when trying to predict the fourth word, the attention layer will only have access to the words in positions 1 to 3.\n",
